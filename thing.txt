input array sorted -> binary search, two pointers

asked for all permutations/subsets -> backtracking

given a tree -> DFS, BFS 

if given a linked list then -> two pointers

if !recursion -> stack

if must solve in-place then -> Swap corresponding values, Store one or more different values in the same pointer

if asked for maximum/minimum subarray/subset/options then -> Dynamic programming

If asked for top/least K items then -> Heap, QuickSelect

If asked for common strings then -> Map, Trie

Else -> Map/Set for O(1) time & O(n) space, Sort input for O(nlogn) time and O(1) space
